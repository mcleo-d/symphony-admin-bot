Welcome to the Symphony Developer Pod! This pod will be your home where you will be able to build your apps, bots and integrations between Symphony and your product. <br/>
This pod is running the latest Symphony version, and is inherently less stable than a production Symphony pod.<br/> 
This pod is only intended for development use.<br/>
Your account information is provided below:<br/>
Bot username: {BOT_ID}<br/>
App ID: {APP_ID}<br/>
Your app certificate and bot certificate have been attached to this message.<br/>

If you are building an extension app, we recommend that you put the app ID in some form of configuration to enable you to easily change the it down the line.<br/>
You are now ready to start building! Click here to see the latest Symphony developer documentation on how to create an app: <br/>
